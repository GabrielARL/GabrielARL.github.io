  What Does an Underwater Acoustics Researcher Do?
Underwater acoustics researchers use hydrophones to detect sounds made by fish, whales, dolphins, and other marine life. These devices are placed on the ocean floor and record the sounds that pass through the water.
Measure the Speed of Sound Waves.
Hydrophones are used to measure the speed of sound waves. This helps scientists understand how fast sound travels through different materials. Scientists also use them to study the behavior of marine mammals such as whales and dolphins.
Determine the Direction of Sound Waves.
A hydrophone measures the speed of sound waves by measuring the pressure changes caused when the sound wave hits the surface of the water. It does this by using a microphone connected to a computer.
Identify Animals by Their Sounds.
In order to identify different species of fish, researchers use underwater microphones to record the sounds made by each animal. These recordings are then analyzed with software to help them identify the type of fish.
Detect Objects with High Frequency Sound.
Researchers also study how sound travels through water. This helps them understand how animals move through the ocean and how they communicate with one another.
Analyze Data from Multiple Sources.
To do this job, researchers must collect data from multiple sources. These sources include underwater microphones, hydrophones, and sonar systems.
